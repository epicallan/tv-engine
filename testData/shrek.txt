MTN sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience caused and requests that all the disconnected customers urgently present their registration documents at any registration points so that their MTN SIM Cards may be reactivated.  We are doing everything possible to make the reactivation process as easy as possible and have increased the number of registration points to provide convenience and increase our customer service support to handle your enquiries through our call centre.  We would like to reassure our disconnected customers that we value your loyalty to MTN, and will be keeping your MTN number in the MTN family for you, while we await for your full registration.  MTN Mobile Money customers will still be able to transact so that your funds can be withdrawn if required. Again, we recommend that these MTN Mobile Money customers urgently register at the nearest MTN registration point so that all their MTN services can be reactivated.  If you have been disconnected, we urge you to immediately visit your MTN registration point with a valid ID to register or go to www.mtn.co.ug/register and register online. Your disconnected number will be reactivated upon the successful registration of your MTN SIM Card. Register today to keep your MTN number and access all your MTN services.
